# Tekken Movement Tool
I designed this tool to be helpful for people who are struggling with movement in Tekken. Also seeing how Tekken 8 is just on the horizon I figured it would be the perfect time for a tool like this.

## What does it do exactly?
This app takes in the inputs from your controller that you have plugged into the computer at the time and runs in the background. While you are playing it takes your inputs up to 30 times and will give you back a ratio of how many misinputs vs how many correct inputs which can then be uploaded to your profile and then you can see where you stack up in the community with a leader that is changing as people practice and get better over time as well.

# Things to be worked on:

1. Right now the only way to see a misinput is the app to also be on your screen and see that it is a misinput. There will be an implementation of a sound so that you know when you messed up the input.
2. As of this momemnt there is only the console.log to show the correct inputs, this feature will be one of the first to be added but there will be a HUD for the inputs so you can also see what you input just in case you want to practice and not have tekken open.
3. Player 1 side is the only side that works at this point, There will be Player 2 side functionality going forward.
